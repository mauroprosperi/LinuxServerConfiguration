# LinuxServerConfiguration

You will take a baseline installation of a Linux server and prepare it to host your web applications. You will secure your server from a number of attack vectors, install and configure a database server, and deploy one of your existing web applications onto it.

# Why this Project?

A deep understanding of exactly what your web applications are doing, how they are hosted, and the interactions between multiple systems are what define you as a Full Stack Web Developer. In this project, youâ€™ll be responsible for turning brand-new, bare bones, Linux server into the secure and efficient web application host your applications need.


## Instruction


### Initialize your server on [Amazon Lightsail][1]

[1]:https://aws.amazon.com/es/lightsail/

  
 - Step by step:
 
    - Log in
    - Create an instance
    - Choose an instance image: Ubuntu
    - Follow the instructions provide to SSH into your server.
    
### SSH into the server
* From the Account menu on Amazon Lightsail, click on SSH keys tab and download the Default Private Key.
* Move this private key file named LightsailDefaultPrivateKey-*.pem into the local folder ~/.ssh and rename it lightsail_key.rsa.
* In your terminal, type: chmod 600 ~/.ssh/lightsail_key.rsa.
* To connect to the instance via the terminal: ssh -i ~/.ssh/lightsail_key.rsa ubuntu@34.203.28.148, where 34.203.28.148 is the public IP address of the instance.


### Security

 * Update all currently installed packcages (this could take a while)
 ~~~
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get upgrade
 ~~~
 
 * Configure the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW)
 ~~~
  sudo ufw status                     <-- to check firewall status
  sudo ufw default deny incoming
  sudo ufw default allow outgoing
  sudo ufw allow 2200/tcp
  sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
  sudo ufw allow 123/tcp
  sudo ufw allow www
  sudo ufw enable
 ~~~
 
 * Change the ssh port from 22 to 2200 and change `permitRootLogin` from `without-password` to `no`

 ~~~
 sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
 ~~~
 
Change the port number on line 5 from 22 to 2200.
Save and exit using CTRL+X and confirm with Y then press ENTER.
Restart SSH: `sudo service ssh restart`.

* Click on the Manage option of the Amazon Lightsail Instance, then the Networking tab, and then change the firewall configuration to match the internal firewall settings above. 

* Allow ports 80 (TCP), 123(Custom UDP), and 2200(Custom TCP), and deny the default port 22

* You can now login as `ssh -i ~/.ssh/lightsail_key.rsa -p 2200 ubuntu@34.203.28.148` where 34.203.28.148 is the public IP of the instance

### User configuration
 
 * Create a new user name grader in order to the project be reviewed.
 ~~~
 sudo add user grader
 ~~~
 
 * Give grader the permission to sudo.
 ~~~
 sudo nano /etc/sudoers.d/grader
 ~~~
   and inside this file add the text, then save.
 ~~~
 grader ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
 ~~~
 
 * Configura timezone to UTC
 ~~~
 sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
 ~~~
 
### Create an SSH key pair for grader

   - On the local machine:
        Run ssh-keygen
        Enter file in which to save the key (I gave the name grader_key) in the local directory ~/.ssh
        Enter in a passphrase twice. Two files will be generated ( ~/.ssh/grader_key and ~/.ssh/grader_key.pub)
        Run cat ~/.ssh/grader_key.pub and copy the contents of the file
        Log in to the grader's virtual machine
  - On the grader's virtual machine:
        Create a new directory called ~/.ssh (mkdir .ssh)
        Run sudo nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys and paste the content into this file, save and exit
        Give the permissions: chmod 700 .ssh and chmod 644 .ssh/authorized_keys
        Check in /etc/ssh/sshd_config file if PasswordAuthentication is set to no
        Restart SSH: sudo service ssh restart
  - On the local machine, run: ssh -i ~/.ssh/grader_key -p 2200 grader@34.203.28.148.




### Install and configure

* Ngnix

We use ngnix instead of Apache, configuration steps can be found here
